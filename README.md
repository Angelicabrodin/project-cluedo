`PROJECT 5`

This project is a part of my Technigo Bootcamp. 

This project is to build a piece of the Cluedo board game with Javascript and to use arrays,objects and diffrent functions together with some html and css to reveal a murder mystery. 

This week's been all about Javascript, learning about arrays and objects. We're going to hook that up with some html and css in this project!
