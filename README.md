Project 5, build a Cluedo-game, made during my Technigo Bootcamp 2019. 

## 1. What is this?
This project is to build a piece of the Cluedo board game

## 2. What did I do?
I have used Javascript and arrays,objects and different functions together with some html and css to build this game and to finally reveal a murder mystery when submitting the button. If I will have more time on this project I would definetely put more time on the styling and to make it responsive, it is now desktop first and it definetely needs some polishing. 

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
